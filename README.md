# TicTacToe2023
TicTacToe.py is a simulated Tic Tac Toe game coded in Python in Pycharm and with help from the John Zelle's graphics.py library.
Game is fully functional and contains buttons for restarting, saving the game, and loading the game. 
TicTacToe.txt is used to save data about the current game, which then can be revisisted through the load feature.
Originally created for my Intro to Programming class, while it may be considered rudiementary by some, it's still a project that I am proud of and I hope is a sign for better things to come.
